Putting idea here for now.

Draft/backlog organization and different types of posts:
* blog posts (long)
* best practice snippets (short, maybe a single running post?)
    * TODO: come up with a catchier name and include it in title of post(s)? Like Words of Wisdom. Or Wise-bits.
* misc thoughts (prob won't come to anything)
