title: Be your team's CTO
---

Every once in a while, a mentee asks me _I am soon-to-be/recently promoted to Senior Engineer, how do I be a good Sr Eng? How do I be a good tech lead for my team?_

## Imposter syndrome, stress, expectations

First of all, congratulations! You being promoted is a sign that the organization trusts you enough to rise into that position and do a good job. Imposter syndrome is a very real thing, so you need to both acknowledge that you might feel slightly uncomfortable for a while, and also give yourself the permission to not know everything that is expected of a tenured Senior Engineer. No one else in the org is comparing a freshly promoted Sr Eng to the ones who have been there for years. Do you compare a freshly promoted engineer to tenured ones, or a new university hire to a junior engineer who's been on the team for a while? Rhetorical, no, you don't.

However, there is nothing I can say to you that will completely remove that uncomfortable, maybe stressful feeling that you have a lot of catching up to do. When I got promoted to Senior Eng, I told my manager I wasn't super excited about all the new responsibility, and she said "all we want you to do is keep doing what you've been doing". She was very supportive and not pressuring. Still, I felt the moment my title changed, I had a ton of different new skills and areas that I had to play catch-up on. I was overwhelmed for the first 6 months, and it gradually stabilized to a point of being somewhat comfortable around 12 months or so. It is human nature, it is almost unavoidable. So be explicit with yourself and acknowledge that you will most likely feel some self-induced pressure to learn quickly, but also be aware that no one else is expecting to be a top performing Senior Engineer in the first year+ of working that role.

Give yourself permission to be behind a little bit, and be patient with yourself to learn.

## CTO of the 2-pizza team

Now what does a a tech lead actually do?

Pretend you're the CTO of this small startup team/org. What would you do if you
had to choose? Would you choose A or B, or choose to spend more effort gathering
info? What would you do to gather more info? What if time was no constraint? What
if money were no constraint? What if you had very


Side note: when talking in my head, it's much easier to stop mid-sentence, rewind, and re-do part of a sentence to change direction. With written/spoken text, I fall into the trap of wanting to continue the thought. How to break that to get productivity/quality of thoughts with durability?


## Other TODO

- Growing to tech lead: individual success -> team success
    - team = current team and future team, not just this month's projects
- be informed about most WIP projects
- be informed of opportunity cost: what are we not doing
- understand why each project is important
- understand when tech debt is taken and why it's okay
- understand what tech debt exists and what tech debt should be resolved as part of a new project

## What it isn't

Being right all the time. In fact, I think it's a super important skill to be able to admit your initial judgement was wrong and change your opnion in light of new information rather than be stubborn to stick to your initial idea.

You don't have to be right all the time. You just have to be right a lot of the time, AND be transparent about when you don't know or aren't confident in something. Over time, you will earn trust from leadership.
