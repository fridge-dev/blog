Design docs are a tool to save you time.

Don't treat it as a precious and sacred artifact, don't fill in details just to show that you've been putting in lots of effort, don't fantasize that future generations will cherish it as such a scholarly example of quality writing.
Get as straight to the point as possible, get consensus, and get on with building what you've designed!

Most of the time, design should feel scrappy. When your design gets "accepted", you _should_ feel like there was more polish and word-smithing you wanted to do, or maybe there were still a couple of things you wanted to add. If that's not how you feel, you may have gotten to the point of diminishing returns.

Remember, you can always come back to update a doc later if you think it will save the team time long term.

That gets to another point. Saving time doesn't mean just save time of current impl choice. If you're writing a doc about an

vv-get early feedback! Don't draft everything in secret and isolation, don't trick yourself into imagining the ✨big reveal✨ during the first team review meeting. Just don't! Get some early eyes on an incomplete draft, get feedback on if your solution is generally in the right direction, get feedback on which areas need more detail and which are fine enough. That way you spend iteration time where it matters and you can save time going into excruciating detail where it's not needed.

Remember: Design docs should be net-saving you time! If they're not, you're doing it wrong.

When should you write a design doc? When should you not write a design doc

Or to flip it, why don't you just go start building? The risk is that you build

Write design docs exactly as you'd speak to someone, word for word. Write the exact same prose as if you're verbally explaining an idea to someone, with a whiteboard present. Use the whiteboard to aid conversation, and when you do draw on the whiteboard, that's a big indicator that a diagram would be helpful in a doc. And the diagram doesn't have to be any more fancy or polished than a digital replica of what you've drawn on the whiteboard.

...I avoid re-reading and overly editing my sentences as I write them. It's usually most productive to get in a write-only flow, and then go back and word-smith for better density and clarity later. I'm just starting to practice this, but I hope to get to a point where I can type out exactly what I'd say to someone, and do a write-only flow with near-zero edits after the fact. I think that will be a huge boost to productivity, especially when it comes to influential writing, scaling yourself, and maximizing your impact.
