I shouldn't need this doc anymore. Just leaving the phrases around for a while in case I want to edit the post and add some snippets back.

---------

For example, epic projects that are broken into smaller projects/milestones are a form of input goals.

### Using input goals to fight procrastination

As a procrastinator, I often struggle to start on large tasks thinking about the entire effort. For example,  

### Using input goals to focus on what's within your control

If a project has many factors out of your control that could affect the end result, you can use input goals to define what's within your control to achieve. For example, you may want to lose weight (an output goal), but that can be somewhat dependent on your body's metabolism and biochemistry, so it might be more motivating to take input goals such as exercising 5 times a week or eating vegetables in 15 meals a week.

...even if the input goal doesn't capture the entire bigger picture of what you want to achieve...

### Using input goals to deal with ambiguity

If you have no idea how to start towards achieving your end goal, breaking down the problem and coming up with input goals is a great way to demystify the problem.

For example, if your end goal is to reduce the number of incidents that require paging an oncall engineer, you could start by taking an input goal to read through the past 3 months of incidents from 1 single source.

Try not to get caught up with feeling uncertain about if this is the most optimal path towards the end result. You are learning. There are many actions you can do, and usually it's better to pick one and commit than to hesitate. If you're going to fail, fail quickly, iterate, and learn from it.

For example, I previously had a goal of publishing one blog post per month


### Using input goals to break down problems

Let's think about an engineering org that is considering a goal on lowering latency for their website. Many factors affect latency and performance, such

### Problem solving / break-down

Recognizing input goals that can be trivialized and skipped in favor of their output goals is a sign of growing intelligence. Conversely, breaking down an output goal into input goals is a great way to share your intelligence and give a more structured path for your organization to follow.
