Blog purpose (put in readme to remind mysefl): If I write out my ideas, it forces me to understand them better. Also I hope to improve the overall quality of software engineers, in the hopes that I work with some of you some day.


this blog is going to document my opinions and way of thinking about
various topics of being an IC or IC leader on a software engineering

* best practice snippets (short, maybe a single running post?)
* misc thoughts (prob won't come to anything)
