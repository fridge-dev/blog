# blog

Repo for holding SE related blog posts.

## Goals

* Understand my own thinking better. If I write out my ideas, it forces me to understand them better.
* More easily share my ideas with coworkers to help get on the same page more quickly.
* Hopefully help a few readers learn new things. I've definitely gotten help from other random unassuming software engineering blogs. This is my small way of (hopefully) contributing back.
