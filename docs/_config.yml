  This is a software engineering blog covering my interests and ways of thinking about
  various topics of being an IC or IC leader in a software engineering org.
  I’m interested in problem solving, code understandability, design patterns,
  code architecture, system architecture, large scale failure modes, distributed
  systems algorithms, teaching, learning how other people think, figuring out how
  to make complex systems easier for others to understand, and being a leader.
