  This is a software engineering blog covering my interests and ways of thinking about
  various topics of being an IC or IC leader. Iâ€™m interested in problem solving, code
  understandability, design patterns, code architecture, system architecture, large
  scale failure modes, distributed systems algorithms, teaching, learning how other
  people think, figuring out how to make complex systems easier for others to
  understand, and being a leader.
