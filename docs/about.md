Software engineering blog covering topics like programming patterns, code readability, maintaining a software project as a team, self analysis habits, and communication skills. Blog posts will try to be short and to the point, especially soft-skill, stream-of-conciousness posts.

For my day job, I spend a lot of time and effort influencing and teaching others, especially engineers. If you have met me, you probably know I have a lot to say and I love to teach. I hope this blog can be extension of that and cover the wide range of topics that are in my head or that frequently come up in some form in my day to day work.

For coding, I primarily write rust and java, with a little bit of go sprinkled in.

All opinions are my own.
