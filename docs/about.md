### About me

I work with a team to design, build, maintain, and operationally support some critical internal services that power the cloud. I regularly work with and influence my team and broader organization. I spend a lot of time and effort influencing and teaching others how to think about solving problems. If you have met me, you probably know I have a lot to say and I love to teach. I hope this blog can be extension of that and cover the wide range of topics that are in my head or that frequently come up in some form in my day to day work.

For coding, I primarily write Rust and Java, with a little bit of Go sprinkled in.

All opinions are my own.

### What is "Fridge" Dev? Do you develop software for refridgerators?

It's just a cool name, might change it later.
